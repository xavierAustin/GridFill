# GridFill
Taking light inspiration from mobile games from the late 2000s and early 2010s, GridFill is a fast paced casual puzzle game where you fill a grid with pentominoes and other like shapes.
Race against the clock to try for a new highscore, use powerups for a short term boost, or test your mental fortitude with Evolution, a mode where the grid gets larger over time.
## How to play
**Tap and drag** the pieces into the grid– or alternatively, **tap** to select a piece and tap again to place it– such that there is no empty space remaining.
If you make a mistake, don't worry! Simply click the misplaced to reposition it or click and drag it to a new location.
If you make a bunch of mistakes, worry a little! **Double tap** on the piece tray to instantly remove every placed peice from the grid.
You can use your emmassed points at the shop to purchase themes or alternative ways to play.
